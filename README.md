# Mesob Restaurant

<p>
Mesob restaurant is a nice restaurant located in Uppsala city which is known for being the center of education in Sweden. The city is home to Uppsala University where Prof.Carl Linneaus worked. He is renowed for his system of classifying and naming nature. The owner of Mesob restaurant wants to serve customers with delicious food from an east african country called Eritrea. Thus, the website was developed to enable Mesob restaurant owner to take bookings from customers, and to allow customers to book time at the restaurant so that they can dine there. It runs on Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.
